# kandenflygamed
My first project testing out vue.js. A simple SPA about airline carry-on restrictions. The code is not beautiful in any way. Will probably come back and refactor the code at a later stage when I have time to learn vue and not just butcher it together.

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA). Installing the app on your device will let you experience it like a native app with offline capabilities.
